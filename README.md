django-quickstart
=================

Shell scripts that help you quickly start a Django project.

Django's setup.py is only going so far in helping you start a Django
project quickly. A lot of additional setup is needed if one wants to
follow the best engineering practices. This script should help you
kick start things "the right way" (in no means the only right way). 

If you have any suggestions/feature requests/etc., please open an issue
and I'll look into adding it.
